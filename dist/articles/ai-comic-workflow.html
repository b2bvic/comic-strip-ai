            <h1>The Complete AI Comic Creation Workflow: Tools, Steps, and Automation</h1>
<p>Six hours for four panels.</p>
<p>The math doesn&#39;t work. You started with a story idea at 9am. By 3pm you have four images that almost cohere into a strip. Character drifted twice. Panel 3 needed seven regenerations to get the angle right. You exported Panel 1 at the wrong resolution for Webtoon and had to redo it after assembly.</p>
<p>Production without system is triage. Every session reinvents solutions to solved problems. You&#39;re making decisions under fatigue that should have been automated weeks ago.</p>
<p>The difference between hobbyists who burn out at Episode 12 and creators who ship Episode 100 isn&#39;t talent or tools. It&#39;s workflow architecture. Documented processes that make the fiftieth strip faster than the fifth.</p>
<p>This isn&#39;t about working harder. It&#39;s about building a pipeline where creative energy goes toward storytelling instead of fighting technical chaos.</p>
<h2>Pre-Production: Story Development with AI Assistance</h2>
<p>The work before generation determines whether generation succeeds. Skipping pre-production guarantees wasted hours downstream.</p>
<h3>Using ChatGPT for Dialogue and Beat Sheets</h3>
<p><strong>ChatGPT</strong> functions as a writing partner for script development. Not a replacement for creative vision—a sounding board that accelerates iteration.</p>
<p>Beat sheets map story structure to panel allocations. For a four-panel strip:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Panel 1:</strong> Setup (establish situation, characters present)</li>
<li><strong>Panel 2:</strong> Development (complicate the setup, introduce tension)</li>
<li><strong>Panel 3:</strong> Turn (unexpected element, reversal, or escalation)</li>
<li><strong>Panel 4:</strong> Punchline or resolution</li>
</ul>
<p>Feed <strong>ChatGPT</strong> your concept and request beat sheet variations:</p>
<pre><code>I&#39;m creating a 4-panel comic strip about a programmer discovering their AI assistant has been rewriting their code without permission. Give me three different beat sheet structures with specific panel descriptions.
</code></pre>
<p>The model generates structural options. You select elements that match your comedic or dramatic timing.</p>
<p>For dialogue specifically, paste your draft and request alternatives:</p>
<pre><code>Here&#39;s the dialogue for Panel 3. Give me five variations that hit the same emotional beat but with different comedic timing.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>ChatGPT</strong> produces options faster than drafting from scratch. Your judgment selects what works. The collaboration multiplies output without outsourcing taste.</p>
<p>Long-form projects—graphic novels, serialized stories—benefit from scene outlines before individual strip scripting. Map the arc across episodes, then develop individual beats within that structure.</p>
<h3>Claude AI for Plot Consistency Checking</h3>
<p><strong>Claude</strong> excels at tracking narrative continuity across longer documents.</p>
<p>Paste your entire story bible—character descriptions, relationship histories, timeline of events—and request consistency audits:</p>
<pre><code>Here&#39;s my story bible for a 50-episode webcomic. Review for internal contradictions, timeline inconsistencies, and character behavior that contradicts established traits.
</code></pre>
<p>The model identifies conflicts humans miss when deep in creative flow. A character whose backstory mentions growing up in poverty shouldn&#39;t casually reference inherited wealth three episodes later unless that contradiction is intentional.</p>
<p><strong>Claude</strong> also handles scene logic:</p>
<pre><code>In this scene, Jake enters through the east door and confronts Maria who was sitting by the window. Check the blocking—does the physical positioning make sense given the room layout I described earlier?
</code></pre>
<p>These checks catch errors before they become panel specifications that waste generation attempts.</p>
<h3>Storyboard Templates: Paper vs. Digital (Miro, Figma)</h3>
<p>Storyboards translate scripts into visual plans. The format matters less than the practice of planning before generating.</p>
<p><strong>Paper storyboards:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Zero software friction</li>
<li>Faster for rough blocking and gesture sketches</li>
<li>No file management overhead</li>
<li>Harder to revise, share, or reference during generation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Miro:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Infinite canvas for sprawling projects</li>
<li>Easy collaboration with co-writers or editors</li>
<li>Sticky notes for comments and revisions</li>
<li>Can embed reference images and link to prompts</li>
<li>Browser-based accessibility</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Figma:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Precise panel layout design</li>
<li>Exportable templates for consistent formatting</li>
<li>Version history for tracking iterations</li>
<li>Component libraries for recurring elements</li>
<li>Steeper learning curve for non-designers</li>
</ul>
<p>For solo creators producing 4-8 panel strips, paper or a simple note-taking app suffices. For graphic novels or team productions, <strong>Miro</strong> or <strong>Figma</strong> provide structure that prevents scope creep and maintains visual consistency across episodes.</p>
<p>Regardless of tool, storyboards should specify:</p>
<ul>
<li>Camera angle and shot type for each panel</li>
<li>Character positions and expressions</li>
<li>Key dialogue or narration</li>
<li>Environmental details that require prompting</li>
<li>Panel aspect ratio and layout relationship to adjacent panels</li>
</ul>
<p>This becomes your generation checklist. Each panel has documented requirements before you touch an AI tool.</p>
<h2>Panel Generation: Tool Selection by Comic Style</h2>
<p>Different tools suit different aesthetic requirements and production volumes. Selection isn&#39;t about &quot;best&quot;—it&#39;s about fit.</p>
<h3>Midjourney for High-Fidelity Illustrations</h3>
<p><strong>Midjourney</strong> produces the most aesthetically refined output for illustration-forward comics. Rich textures, coherent lighting, painterly rendering when specified.</p>
<p>Workflow within <strong>Midjourney</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Generate initial concept with detailed prompt</li>
<li>Use <code>/describe</code> on successful outputs to understand what keywords produce desired results</li>
<li>Iterate with <code>--seed</code> to maintain base characteristics while adjusting details</li>
<li>Apply <code>--sref</code> style references for cross-panel consistency</li>
<li>Upscale final selections with preferred upscaler (<code>--v 6</code> defaults work for most cases)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Discord</strong> interface limitations require workarounds:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create dedicated channels for each project to avoid prompt history chaos</li>
<li>Use <code>/settings</code> to lock aspect ratio and quality parameters</li>
<li>Download immediately—image URLs expire</li>
<li>Maintain external prompt log since Discord search is unreliable</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Midjourney</strong> excels at: realistic illustration, painterly styles, atmospheric environments, detailed character portraits.</p>
<p><strong>Midjourney</strong> struggles with: text rendering, exact pose matching, rapid iteration (queue times), batch processing.</p>
<h3>DALL-E 3 for Quick Iterations and Edits</h3>
<p><strong>DALL-E 3</strong> through <strong>ChatGPT</strong> offers conversational workflow that accelerates iteration.</p>
<p>The interaction model differs fundamentally from <strong>Midjourney</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>User: Generate a panel showing Jake discovering the message on his desk. Morning light through blinds, film noir mood.

ChatGPT: [generates image]

User: The lighting is good but Jake should be facing the opposite direction. Keep everything else the same.

ChatGPT: [regenerates with adjustment]

User: Now show me the same scene from over his shoulder, revealing what the message says.

ChatGPT: [generates new angle maintaining established elements]
</code></pre>
<p>Conversation context preserves decisions. You&#39;re building on previous outputs rather than starting cold each time.</p>
<p><strong>Edit mode</strong> allows regional modifications without full regeneration. Mask areas to preserve, describe what should change, maintain the rest.</p>
<p><strong>DALL-E 3</strong> excels at: rapid iteration, conversational refinement, maintaining context across related images, following complex compositional instructions.</p>
<p><strong>DALL-E 3</strong> struggles with: consistent artistic style across sessions, highly specific aesthetic requirements, avoiding certain sanitized/corporate looks.</p>
<h3>ComfyUI and Automatic1111 for Advanced Control</h3>
<p>Local <strong>Stable Diffusion</strong> installations through <strong>ComfyUI</strong> or <strong>Automatic1111</strong> provide capabilities impossible in cloud services.</p>
<p><strong>ControlNet</strong> integration enables:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exact pose matching using skeleton inputs</li>
<li>Depth map control for consistent spatial relationships</li>
<li>Line art guidance for matching rough sketches</li>
<li>Face restoration for detail recovery</li>
<li>Segmentation control for element positioning</li>
</ul>
<p>A workflow for action sequence consistency:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create rough pose sketches (even stick figures work)</li>
<li>Process through <strong>ControlNet</strong> pose estimation</li>
<li>Generate panels using poses as structural constraints</li>
<li>Character LoRA ensures identity consistency</li>
<li>Style LoRA ensures aesthetic consistency</li>
<li>Batch process variations, select best outputs</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ComfyUI</strong> node-based interface allows workflow visualization and saving. Complex generation pipelines become reproducible one-click operations.</p>
<p>The learning curve is steep. Expect 20-40 hours before local <strong>Stable Diffusion</strong> workflows match the output quality of <strong>Midjourney</strong>. After that threshold, capabilities exceed cloud services for specific use cases.</p>
<p><strong>Stable Diffusion</strong> excels at: full control, custom model training, batch automation, specific style replication via LoRA, offline operation.</p>
<p><strong>Stable Diffusion</strong> struggles with: initial setup complexity, hardware requirements (8GB+ VRAM minimum, 12GB+ preferred), keeping up with rapid ecosystem changes.</p>
<h2>Post-Production Assembly and Lettering</h2>
<p>Generated panels aren&#39;t finished comics. Assembly, text integration, and formatting transform images into sequential art.</p>
<h3>Photoshop Layer Organization for Multi-Panel Layouts</h3>
<p><strong>Photoshop</strong> remains industry standard for comic assembly. Layer organization determines whether editing is manageable.</p>
<p>Recommended structure:</p>
<pre><code>Layer Group: Page 01
  └── Panel 01
      ├── Background
      ├── Character Layer
      ├── Effects (speed lines, impacts)
      └── Adjustment Layers (color correction)
  └── Panel 02
      ├── Background
      ├── Character Layer
      ├── Effects
      └── Adjustment Layers
  └── Gutters and Borders
  └── Speech Bubbles
      ├── Bubble Shapes
      └── Dialogue Text
  └── Sound Effects
  └── Page Adjustments (overall color grade)
</code></pre>
<p>Smart Objects preserve editability. If you need to swap a panel, replace the smart object contents without rebuilding effects and adjustments.</p>
<p><strong>Actions</strong> automate repetitive tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Panel border creation with consistent width and color</li>
<li>Export preset for platform requirements (Webtoon vertical, Instagram square, print bleed)</li>
<li>Color correction curves applied across all panels uniformly</li>
</ul>
<p>Record actions once, replay indefinitely. The fifteen minutes spent creating an action saves hours across a project.</p>
<h3>Clip Studio Paint Speech Bubble and Font Tools</h3>
<p><strong>Clip Studio Paint</strong> offers comic-specific features that <strong>Photoshop</strong> lacks or requires plugins to replicate.</p>
<p>Built-in speech balloon tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tail direction adjustment with bezier handles</li>
<li>Multiple balloon styles (thought clouds, shout bubbles, whisper boxes)</li>
<li>Automatic text wrapping within balloon boundaries</li>
<li>Balloon linking for multi-part dialogue</li>
</ul>
<p>Font management includes standard comic fonts and reading-optimized typefaces. The application handles vertical text for manga workflows without rotation workarounds.</p>
<p><strong>Clip Studio Paint</strong> also provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tone patterns for manga-style shading</li>
<li>Built-in perspective rulers that snap to vanishing points</li>
<li>Panel border tools with automatic gutter spacing</li>
<li>Story editor for managing text across pages</li>
</ul>
<p>For creators producing manga-influenced work or prioritizing lettering workflow, <strong>Clip Studio Paint</strong> at $50 (one-time purchase, perpetual license) outperforms <strong>Photoshop</strong> subscription for comic-specific tasks.</p>
<h3>Free Alternatives: GIMP, Krita, Inkscape Workflows</h3>
<p>Budget constraints don&#39;t prevent professional-quality comic production.</p>
<p><strong>GIMP</strong> handles photo manipulation and panel assembly. Layer organization matches <strong>Photoshop</strong> capability. The interface requires adjustment if you&#39;re trained on Adobe products—tools exist but live in different locations.</p>
<p><strong>Krita</strong> focuses on digital painting but includes comic template features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Page management for multi-page documents</li>
<li>Built-in speech bubble tools</li>
<li>Panel division templates</li>
<li>Export presets for print and web</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Inkscape</strong> provides vector capability for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resolution-independent lettering</li>
<li>Clean speech balloon shapes</li>
<li>Logo and title design</li>
<li>Sound effect typography that scales without pixelation</li>
</ul>
<p>A combined workflow: Generate panels with AI tools, assemble in <strong>GIMP</strong> or <strong>Krita</strong>, add vector text in <strong>Inkscape</strong>, export final composites.</p>
<p>The tools are capable. The learning investment is similar to paid alternatives. Budget constraints trade money for time, not quality for compromise.</p>
<h2>Batch Processing and Automation</h2>
<p>Manual processes scale poorly. Episode 50 should require less effort than Episode 5.</p>
<h3>Replicate API Python Scripts for Bulk Generation</h3>
<p><strong>Replicate</strong> hosts <strong>Stable Diffusion</strong> models accessible via API. Programmatic generation enables batch workflows.</p>
<p>Basic script structure:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import replicate
import json

# Load scene descriptions from pre-production
with open(&#39;episode_12_scenes.json&#39;) as f:
    scenes = json.load(f)

# Character consistency via LoRA
model = &quot;your-account/jake-character-lora:version&quot;

results = []
for scene in scenes:
    output = replicate.run(
        model,
        input={
            &quot;prompt&quot;: f&quot;jake, {scene[&#39;description&#39;]}, comic panel, detailed illustration&quot;,
            &quot;negative_prompt&quot;: &quot;blurry, distorted, extra limbs, text&quot;,
            &quot;width&quot;: scene[&#39;width&#39;],
            &quot;height&quot;: scene[&#39;height&#39;],
            &quot;num_outputs&quot;: 3  # Generate variations
        }
    )
    results.append({
        &quot;scene_id&quot;: scene[&#39;id&#39;],
        &quot;outputs&quot;: output
    })

# Save results for selection
with open(&#39;episode_12_outputs.json&#39;, &#39;w&#39;) as f:
    json.dump(results, f)
</code></pre>
<p>Feed the script your pre-production scene file. It generates all panels with variations. You select best outputs rather than prompting individually.</p>
<p>Cost scales linearly—$0.01-0.05 per generation depending on model and parameters. A 20-panel episode with 3 variations each costs $0.60-3.00 in API fees versus hours of manual prompting.</p>
<h3>Zapier Integrations: Script Upload, Auto-Generate, Dropbox</h3>
<p><strong>Zapier</strong> connects non-technical creators to automation without code.</p>
<p>Example pipeline:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Trigger:</strong> New file added to Google Drive &quot;Scripts&quot; folder</li>
<li><strong>Action:</strong> Parse script file to extract scene descriptions</li>
<li><strong>Action:</strong> Call <strong>Replicate</strong> API for each scene</li>
<li><strong>Action:</strong> Download generated images to Dropbox &quot;Raw Panels&quot; folder</li>
<li><strong>Action:</strong> Send Slack notification: &quot;Episode 15 panels ready for review&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p>Setup requires no programming. <strong>Zapier&#39;s</strong> visual builder connects services through dropdowns and field mapping.</p>
<p>More advanced automation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Airtable base triggers generation when scene status changes to &quot;Ready for Generation&quot;</li>
<li>Generated images automatically attached to corresponding Airtable records</li>
<li>Trello cards created for each panel requiring review</li>
<li>Completed panels move through workflow stages automatically</li>
</ul>
<p>The initial setup takes hours. Every subsequent episode benefits from those hours indefinitely.</p>
<h3>Version Control with Git LFS for Large Image Files</h3>
<p>Standard <strong>Git</strong> chokes on large binary files. <strong>Git LFS</strong> (Large File Storage) extends version control to image assets.</p>
<p>Setup:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git lfs install
git lfs track &quot;*.png&quot;
git lfs track &quot;*.psd&quot;
git add .gitattributes
</code></pre>
<p>Now commit images normally. <strong>Git LFS</strong> stores actual files on a separate server while your repository tracks lightweight pointers.</p>
<p>Benefits for comic projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complete history of every panel version</li>
<li>Branch experimental styles without losing working versions</li>
<li>Collaborate with colorists or letterers through pull requests</li>
<li>Roll back to any previous state if updates degrade quality</li>
<li>Audit trail for rights documentation</li>
</ul>
<p>Storage costs apply beyond free tiers—<strong>GitHub</strong> offers 1GB free, then $5/month for 50GB packs. For professional production, the cost is negligible against the protection provided.</p>
<h2>Publishing and Distribution Platforms</h2>
<p>Generation and assembly mean nothing without distribution. Platform requirements shape final output specifications.</p>
<h3>Webtoon Canvas Formatting Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Webtoon Canvas</strong> uses vertical scroll format with specific technical requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Width: 800px recommended (600px minimum, 800px maximum)</li>
<li>Height: Variable, but episodes should be 15,000-20,000px total</li>
<li>Format: JPEG or PNG, RGB color mode</li>
<li>File size: Under 20MB per image (upload in segments)</li>
</ul>
<p>The scroll format changes composition priorities. Horizontal panels don&#39;t translate—redesign for vertical reading flow. Place key elements toward center since mobile screens crop edges.</p>
<p>Episodic structure requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hook within first 2-3 scroll screens</li>
<li>Consistent update schedule (algorithms reward regularity)</li>
<li>Thumbnail image that reads at small size</li>
<li>Episode title and series branding</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Webtoon</strong> algorithms favor engagement metrics. Comments, shares, and subscriptions influence visibility more than view counts alone.</p>
<h3>Self-Hosting with WordPress and ComicPress Themes</h3>
<p>Owned platforms eliminate dependence on algorithm changes and platform policies.</p>
<p><strong>WordPress</strong> with comic-specific themes provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatic archive navigation</li>
<li>RSS feeds for subscribers</li>
<li>Control over monetization (your ads, your revenue)</li>
<li>Full ownership of reader relationships</li>
<li>No content policy restrictions beyond legal requirements</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ComicPress</strong> and its descendants (<strong>Flavor</strong>, <strong>Flavor Legacy</strong>) add:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scheduled comic posting</li>
<li>Chapter organization</li>
<li>Character pages with auto-generated appearance lists</li>
<li>Transcript support for accessibility</li>
<li>Integration with Patreon or Ko-fi for supporters-only content</li>
</ul>
<p>Technical requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Domain name ($10-15/year)</li>
<li>Hosting ($5-30/month depending on traffic)</li>
<li>SSL certificate (usually included with hosting)</li>
<li>Basic WordPress administration knowledge</li>
</ul>
<p>The tradeoff is discoverability. <strong>Webtoon</strong> has built-in audience. Self-hosted sites require external marketing to build readership.</p>
<h3>NFT Comics on OpenSea and Foundation</h3>
<p>Digital collectibles create alternative monetization without traditional publishing.</p>
<p><strong>OpenSea</strong> supports:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single editions or limited runs</li>
<li>Unlockable content (high-resolution files, bonus panels)</li>
<li>Secondary sale royalties (2.5-10% of resale value)</li>
<li>Collection organization for series</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Foundation</strong> positions as premium/curated, requiring invitation for creator accounts. Higher average sale prices, smaller potential audience.</p>
<p>NFT comic considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gas fees (transaction costs) fluctuate—batch minting during low-fee periods</li>
<li>Market volatility affects collector willingness to purchase</li>
<li>Community building matters more than individual work quality</li>
<li>Secondary market only exists if primary collectors want to resell</li>
</ul>
<p>The format suits collectors seeking unique digital ownership, not readers seeking entertainment. Different audience, different marketing approach.</p>
<h2>Analytics and Iteration Workflow</h2>
<p>Data improves future output. Track what works, eliminate what doesn&#39;t.</p>
<h3>Tracking Engagement: Which Panels Perform Best</h3>
<p>Platform analytics reveal reader behavior:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where readers pause (scroll heatmaps on <strong>Webtoon</strong>)</li>
<li>Which episodes have highest completion rates</li>
<li>Where readers drop off within episodes</li>
<li>Comment sentiment and frequency</li>
</ul>
<p>Analyze patterns:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do action-heavy episodes outperform dialogue episodes?</li>
<li>Which character interactions generate most comments?</li>
<li>Do cliffhangers increase return rate for next episode?</li>
<li>At what word count does engagement drop?</li>
</ul>
<p>Self-hosted sites use <strong>Google Analytics</strong> or privacy-respecting alternatives like <strong>Plausible</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Traffic sources (which platforms send readers?)</li>
<li>Time on page (are readers actually reading or bouncing?)</li>
<li>Page flow (do readers continue to next episode?)</li>
<li>Device breakdown (mobile optimization priority?)</li>
</ul>
<h3>A/B Testing Prompts for Higher Quality Output</h3>
<p>Systematic testing beats intuition for prompt optimization.</p>
<p>Test one variable at a time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Style keywords: &quot;detailed illustration&quot; vs. &quot;comic book style&quot; vs. &quot;graphic novel art&quot;</li>
<li>Camera angles: &quot;low angle&quot; vs. &quot;dramatic low angle&quot; vs. &quot;worm&#39;s eye view&quot;</li>
<li>Lighting terms: &quot;dramatic lighting&quot; vs. &quot;cinematic lighting&quot; vs. &quot;film noir lighting&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Document results:</p>

<p>Over time, you develop a personal prompt vocabulary optimized for your specific aesthetic goals and chosen tools.</p>
<h3>Reader Feedback Loops for Story Adjustments</h3>
<p>Comments contain signal within noise. Track recurring feedback themes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Character confusion (&quot;Is that the same person from Episode 3?&quot;)</li>
<li>Pacing complaints (&quot;This arc is dragging&quot;)</li>
<li>Clarity issues (&quot;I don&#39;t understand what happened in Panel 4&quot;)</li>
<li>Enthusiasm markers (&quot;I can&#39;t wait to see where this goes&quot;)</li>
</ul>
<p>Create feedback categories. Tally frequency. Adjust production priorities based on patterns rather than individual complaints.</p>
<p>Structured feedback collection:</p>
<ul>
<li>End-of-episode polls (&quot;Rate this episode 1-5&quot;)</li>
<li>Periodic surveys for active readers</li>
<li>Discord or community space for ongoing conversation</li>
<li>Patreon polls for supporters to influence direction</li>
</ul>
<p>Reader feedback shouldn&#39;t dictate creative decisions. It should inform whether your creative intentions are landing. If you intended a moment to be sad and readers found it confusing, the problem is execution, not vision.</p>

<p>Workflow architecture transforms AI comic creation from unsustainable hobby into scalable production. The initial investment in systems—pre-production templates, tool selection criteria, post-production pipelines, automation scripts, publishing workflows, feedback loops—costs hours upfront but saves hundreds downstream.</p>
<p>Episode 50 should feel easier than Episode 5. Characters load from reference libraries. Prompts pull from tested templates. Assembly follows documented procedures. Publishing happens through automated pipelines. Analytics inform next episode planning.</p>
<p>The creative work—story, character, emotion, humor—deserves your full attention. Systems handle everything else.</p>
<p>[INTERNAL: AI comic character consistency] — Workflow depends on consistency techniques to avoid regeneration waste.</p>
<p>[INTERNAL: AI comic panel composition] — Pre-production storyboards specify composition requirements covered in detail here.</p>
<p>[INTERNAL: AI comic copyright and legal] — Platform compliance documentation fits within the publishing workflow phase.</p>
<p>[INTERNAL: AI superhero comics] — Genre-specific workflow variations for action-heavy illustration styles.</p>
