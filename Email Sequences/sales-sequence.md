## Email 1: The Problem Is Bigger Than You Think

**Send Timing:** Day 0 (Launch -3, 3 days before cart open)

**Subject Line:** Why 90% of AI comics fail in the first 10 episodes.

**Preview Text:** It's not the tools. It's the system...

---

### Email Body

You've seen the success stories.

Webtoon creators with 100K subscribers publishing 3 episodes per week. AI comic artists pulling $5K/month on Patreon from a single series. Instagram accounts blowing up with panels that look like they came from a professional illustration studio.

You try.

Episode 1 looks decent. Took 8 hours but you figured out the character's look. Published. 47 likes.

Episode 2 takes 10 hours. You forgot the exact prompt structure from Episode 1. The protagonist's eyes are slightly different. The costume color shifted from navy to royal blue. Nobody notices but you. You notice everything.

Episode 5. Character consistency breaks hard. Three regenerations before Panel 1 matches the Episode 1 reference. Your workflow notes are scattered across four different apps. You spend 90 minutes hunting for the seed number you used in Episode 3.

Episode 8. You're exhausted before you start. The technical chaos compounds every session. You open Discord, stare at the prompt bar, and close the laptop.

By Episode 10, you quit. Not because you lack talent or ideas. Because you lack system.

The successful AI comic creators you're watching didn't get lucky with better prompts. They built workflows that make consistency mechanical. They documented every decision so Episode 50 takes 3 hours, not 8. They solved the tool problems once and never solved them again.

Wednesday I'm opening the AI Comic Creation Masterclass.

Last time I did this, 200 people enrolled in 4 days and I closed it for 6 months to deliver results. The course isn't about prompts. It's about the production system that separates Episode 100 creators from Episode 9 burnouts.

Next email: The Three-Phase System that eliminates the chaos.

## Email 2: The Three-Phase System

**Send Timing:** Day 1 (Launch -2)

**Subject Line:** Pre-production, Generation, Post-production. Miss one, waste hours.

**Preview Text:** Most AI comic tutorials only teach Phase 2...

---

### Email Body

Watch any AI comic tutorial.

They show you the prompt. They show you the settings. They show you the output. Panel looks great. Tutorial ends.

They don't show what happened before the recording started. They don't show what happens after the panel exports. They show you Phase 2 and pretend Phases 1 and 3 don't exist.

Then you try it. Phase 2 fails because Phase 1 never happened.

**Phase 1: Pre-Production (30 minutes)**

Story beats confirmed before you open Midjourney. Character references loaded and visible in a second monitor or split screen. Panel compositions selected from a shot list—not improvised mid-generation. Target platform export specs documented so you don't discover Webtoon needs 800px width after you've already generated at 1024.

Most creators skip this. They open the AI tool and start typing. No plan. By Panel 3 they realize the camera angle doesn't match Panel 1's perspective. The background environment changed. The time of day shifted. Regenerate everything.

Pre-production isn't overhead. Pre-production is the work that makes generation work.

**Phase 2: Generation (90 minutes)**

Prompt execution with consistency checks built into the process. Seed anchoring active from Panel 1. Reference image visible in Discord side-by-side. Quality verification before advancing—you don't move to Panel 3 until Panel 2 matches.

This is where the tutorials live. It's the visible part. It's also the part that fails without Phase 1 infrastructure.

**Phase 3: Post-Production (60 minutes)**

Assembly with layer organization that survives editing. Lettering using speech bubble templates instead of drawing every bubble from scratch. Color space verification before export. Platform-specific output settings applied.

Skip this phase and your panels look amateur next to properly formatted comics. Do it wrong and you spend 45 minutes re-exporting because Instagram recompressed your colors.

The problem with scattered tutorials: Every video teaches one Phase 2 trick. Nobody teaches the full system.

The Masterclass walks through all three phases with real projects. You don't just watch—you build your own 10-panel strip using the exact checklists and workflows that 400+ AI comic creators have validated over 1,200+ published episodes.

Tomorrow: Doors open. The bonus package is the most aggressive I've offered.

### Email Body

Doors are open.

**AI Comic Creation Masterclass**

8 modules. 12 hours of instruction. Not theory lectures—workflow documentation you execute in parallel with the videos.

---

**Module 1: Character Consistency Engineering**

The foundation everything else depends on.

Midjourney seed + sref workflows that lock visual identity. DALL-E 3 edit mode for panel-to-panel continuity when you need surgical changes. Stable Diffusion LoRA training for building custom character libraries that remember your protagonist forever.

Troubleshooting section covers the 7 most common visual drift patterns: costume color shift, facial feature softening, body proportion changes, hairstyle inconsistency, accessory disappearance, age drift, and expression bleed.

Students report 85%+ consistency rates after implementing Module 1 workflows. The industry average for untrained creators is under 40%.

---

**Module 2: Panel Composition and Shot Framing**

Consistent characters in boring compositions is still boring comics.

Camera angle vocabulary that AI models actually parse: establishing shots, medium close-ups, extreme close-ups, low angle, high angle, Dutch angle, over-the-shoulder, POV.

Rule of Thirds overlay templates for prompt engineering. Leading line specifications for action sequences. Negative space calculations for dramatic pacing.

Genre-specific composition breakdowns for action, dialogue, establishing scenes, and emotional climax panels.

---

**Module 3: Legal and Ethical Compliance**

The unsexy module that saves your comic from deletion.

Platform policy compliance walkthroughs for Webtoon, Tapas, Instagram, TikTok, and Amazon KDP. Current as of Q1 2026.

Tool licensing terms compared: Midjourney Basic vs. Pro vs. Mega. OpenAI DALL-E commercial rights. Stable Diffusion model-specific licenses (CreativeML, custom LoRAs, fine-tuned checkpoints).

Copyright protection strategies for your AI comic IP. Trademark registration guidance for character names and series titles. AI disclosure templates you copy-paste into your About page.

Includes 12 case study breakdowns of real legal disputes with outcomes and prevention lessons.

---

**Module 4: Workflow Architecture**

Where 6-hour sessions become 3.5-hour sessions.

Pre-production checklists with checkbox templates. Storyboard workflows using Miro, Figma, or paper.

Tool selection matrices by comic style (manga, superhero, editorial, educational) and budget tier (free tools only, $50/month stack, $150/month professional stack).

Batch generation scripts for Replicate API. Version control setup using Git LFS for large image files.

File naming conventions that make Episode 50 as organized as Episode 1.

---

**Module 5: Genre-Specific Strategies**

Manga, superhero, editorial, educational—each genre has different requirements.

Manga module covers screen tone prompts, speed lines, emotional iconography (sweat drops, anger marks, blush lines), and right-to-left panel flow formatting for Pixiv and Japanese platforms.

Superhero module covers dynamic poses, cape physics, energy blast effects, team composition shots, and style matching for Jim Lee line art vs. Alex Ross painterly realism.

Editorial module covers caricature generation, visual metaphor construction, and the legal boundaries between satire and defamation.

Educational module covers dual coding theory application, subject-specific visualization (science diagrams, historical settings, abstract math concepts), and LMS integration for Canvas, Blackboard, and Moodle.

---

**Module 6: Post-Production and Publishing**

Assembly workflows in Photoshop and Clip Studio Paint. Layer organization that survives editing. Speech bubble templates and font selection guidelines.

Platform-specific export settings: Webtoon vertical scroll, Instagram square and Stories, print-ready with bleed margins.

Color space management for consistent output across devices.

---

**Module 8: Advanced Automation**

For creators publishing 3+ episodes per week.

Python scripts for bulk panel generation using Replicate API. Batch processing that generates 20 panels while you sleep.

Zapier workflows connecting script uploads to automatic generation queues.

Git version control for managing large comic projects with multiple episodes.

Scaling strategies: when to hire human artists for touch-ups vs. when to automate further.

---

**Included with Enrollment:**

Live monthly Q&A calls. I review student work, troubleshoot specific workflow problems, and answer questions in real time. Recordings available for async viewing.

Private Discord community. 400+ AI comic creators sharing prompts, troubleshooting issues, and providing feedback. Searchable archive of 18 months of problem-solving discussions.

## Email 4: The Workflow Audit Call

**Send Timing:** Day 3 (Launch +1)

**Subject Line:** The bonus that's worth more than the course.

**Preview Text:** I'll show you exactly where your 6 hours are going...

---

### Email Body

74 people enrolled yesterday.

26 audit call slots remain.

The audit call bonus disappears when those 26 are gone—even if the course stays open.

Here's how the call works:

**Before the call:**

You send me your current workflow documentation. What tools you use. What order you work in. How long each phase takes. Where you get stuck. Screenshots of your folder structure. Examples of panels where consistency broke.

I review this before we talk so we don't waste time on orientation.

**During the call (60 minutes):**

Screen share. I watch you walk through your process or I demonstrate fixes using your actual files.

I identify:
- The 3-5 specific bottlenecks eating your time
- Which tools you're using wrong (and what to replace them with)
- Prompt structure fixes for your character consistency issues
- Manual tasks that should be automated
- File organization changes that prevent the "where did I save that?" problem

This isn't generic advice. It's surgery on your specific workflow.

**After the call:**

You receive the recording. You receive a custom checklist built for your exact tool stack. You receive written documentation of every change we discussed.

Previous audit calls have identified:

A creator spending 2 hours on post-production because she didn't know Photoshop's batch actions for speech bubbles. Six-click automation. Now it's 15 minutes.

A creator regenerating panels 8-12 times because his Midjourney parameters were fighting each other. Two parameter changes. Regeneration rate dropped to 2-3 per panel.

A creator losing 45 minutes per session to incorrect export settings. Discovered his color space was mismatched with Webtoon's requirements. Three-minute fix. Never had the problem again.

The audit call is $200 as a standalone service. It's free if you enroll before the 26 remaining slots fill.

After that, the bonus disappears permanently for this cohort.

## Email 5: The Legal Blindspot

**Send Timing:** Day 4 (Launch +2)

**Subject Line:** Your comic is compliant today. Will it be in 3 months?

**Preview Text:** Platform policies change quarterly. Most creators find out when they're suspended...

---

### Email Body

Timeline of AI comic legal changes in the past 18 months:

January 2024: Webtoon updates Terms of Service requiring AI content disclosure. Creators who signed up in 2023 aren't notified. They discover the requirement when their series is flagged for review.

March 2024: Instagram adds AI content labeling requirements. Automatic detection starts flagging AI-generated images. Creators who don't proactively label face algorithmic suppression.

June 2024: Midjourney changes commercial licensing tier structure. What was covered under Basic subscription now requires Pro. Creators using Basic for commercial projects are technically in violation.

September 2024: Amazon KDP tightens AI-generated content rules. New disclosure requirements in book metadata. Retroactive enforcement starts pulling listings that don't comply.

December 2024: U.S. Copyright Office issues updated guidance on AI authorship and human creative input requirements. The threshold for copyright protection shifts.

If you're not actively tracking these changes, you're operating on outdated assumptions. And outdated assumptions get your comic pulled, your account suspended, or your distribution terminated.

The Lifetime Quarterly Legal Updates bonus means you don't track this. I do.

Every 90 days you receive:

**Updated Platform Policy Matrix** — Current ToS requirements for Webtoon, Tapas, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and Amazon KDP. What changed. What it means for your workflow.

**Tool Licensing Summary** — Commercial use terms for Midjourney, OpenAI, Stable Diffusion, and emerging tools. Tier changes. New restrictions.

**New Case Studies** — Legal disputes, outcomes, and prevention lessons. What actually happened when creators got challenged.

**Revised Disclosure Templates** — Copy-paste language updated for current platform requirements.

This bonus is valued at $197 because that's the annual subscription price if I sold legal tracking as a standalone service.

It's free if you enroll in the next 24 hours.

After 9am ET Saturday, the bonus disappears. And you're back to manually checking 15 different Terms of Service documents every quarter—assuming you remember to check at all.

[ENROLL NOW — Legal Updates Included]

112 enrolled. 88 spots remaining.

## Email 6: Last Call — The System vs. The Struggle

**Send Timing:** Day 5 (Launch +3)

**Subject Line:** 16 hours left. Then this closes for 6 months.

**Preview Text:** You can keep struggling with scattered tutorials, or you can get the system...

---

### Email Body

Two paths forward.

**Path 1: Keep piecing it together.**

YouTube tutorial for character consistency. Different YouTube tutorial for panel composition. Reddit thread for Midjourney parameters. Twitter thread for Webtoon formatting. Blog post for legal compliance that's 8 months outdated.

Spend 6-8 hours per 4-panel strip. Fight character drift every session. Discover legal problems after they affect your account. Burn out somewhere between Episode 8 and Episode 15.

This path works. Eventually. People have figured it out through trial and error over 12-18 months. The information exists. It's scattered across 47 sources that contradict each other and don't update when tools change.

**Path 2: Follow a validated system.**

Pre-production checklists that prevent the problems before generation starts. Consistency workflows with specific parameters for Midjourney, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion. Post-production automation that cuts 90 minutes from every session.

Legal compliance documented before platforms ask questions. Publishing workflows that format correctly the first time.

A community of 400+ creators who've already solved the problems you're hitting. Q&A calls where you can ask about your specific situation.

Episode 50 faster and easier than Episode 5.

The Masterclass is Path 2.

8 modules. 12 hours of instruction. Monthly Q&A. Private Discord.

**Enroll in the next 16 hours and you still get:**

- Advanced Prompt Library ($97 value) — 200+ genre-specific prompts
- 1-Hour Workflow Audit Call ($200 value) — I review your setup personally
- Lifetime Quarterly Legal Updates ($197 value) — Never operate on outdated ToS

After 9am ET Sunday: Bonuses gone. Course closes. Next opening: July 2026.

163 enrolled. 37 spots to the cap.

[ENROLL NOW — $297]

If you're on the fence, here's my offer: Reply with your specific situation. I'll tell you whether the Masterclass is the right fit or whether the free resources are enough. No pitch. Honest assessment.

## Email 7: FINAL CALL — Doors Close in 2 Hours

**Send Timing:** Day 6 (Launch +4, 2 hours before cart close)

**Subject Line:** [FINAL] 2 hours until close. 11 spots left.

**Preview Text:** This is the last email. Next opening: July 2026.

---

### Email Body

189 enrolled.
11 spots left.
2 hours until close.

If you're reading this and haven't enrolled, you're in one of three positions:

**Position A: You're still not sure this is for you.**

Fair. Reply to this email right now. Tell me your situation in 2-3 sentences. I'll give you a straight answer within the hour. If it's not a fit, I'll tell you. If it is, I'll explain exactly how it solves your specific problem.

**Position B: You're waiting for a better time.**

There isn't one.

AI tools change monthly. Midjourney V7 is coming. DALL-E's capabilities expand every quarter. Legal policies shift every 90 days. The workflows you build today determine whether you're still creating in 6 months or burned out and frustrated.

The information doesn't get cheaper or easier to find. It gets more fragmented as more tools launch and more platforms update their rules.

**Position C: You think you can figure it out yourself.**

You can. I did. It took 14 months of trial and error, $2,400 in tool subscriptions and courses that didn't work, and approximately 200 hours of troubleshooting that could have been creation time.

The Masterclass compresses that into 12 hours of instruction. It hands you the exact systems working for 400+ creators right now. It includes a community that answers questions within hours instead of forcing you to search Reddit threads from 2023.

The math: $297 for the course vs. 200+ hours of self-teaching. Even valuing your time at $10/hour (and it's worth more), the course pays for itself 6x over.

The bonuses are gone after this email. The audit call slots filled yesterday. The legal updates bundle expires at cart close.
