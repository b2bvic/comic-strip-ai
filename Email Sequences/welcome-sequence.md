# Welcome Email Sequence — ComicStripAI.com

5-email nurture sequence for new lead magnet subscribers. Each email follows PASAIDA structure with progressive emphasis.

## Email 1: The Character Consistency Disaster

**Send Timing:** Day 0 (Immediate)

**Subject Line:** Your character's face changed in Panel 2. Here's why.

**Preview Text:** Most AI comic tutorials skip the part where everything falls apart...

---

### Email Body

You generated Panel 1. Perfect protagonist. Strong jawline, determined eyes, signature scar across the left cheek. You documented the seed number. Saved the prompt. Ready for Panel 2.

Hit regenerate.

Different face. Softer features. No scar. The AI forgot.

You try seed locking. Panel 3. Worse. Now the costume's different colors—blue cape became purple. By Panel 5 you're rage-clicking through 40 variations trying to get the same person twice.

Midjourney doesn't remember. DALL-E doesn't track continuity. Stable Diffusion starts fresh every prompt unless you force it otherwise. These tools generate images. They don't maintain characters.

The tutorials showing flawless 20-panel strips don't show the 30 failed generations that got deleted. They don't show the 3-hour character reference sheet session that happened before Panel 1. They show the highlight reel and let you assume the process was clean.

The Character Consistency Prompt Library you just downloaded contains 50 prompts built specifically for this problem. Seed anchoring. Weighted parameters. Reference image workflows that make the AI remember whether it wants to or not.

Pick one prompt matching your comic style. Generate 3 test panels. If your character stays consistent, you've bypassed the learning curve most creators waste 6 months on.

Tomorrow I'll send you the second problem nobody warns you about—the one that breaks your comics even after you solve consistency.

## Email 2: The Composition Trap

**Send Timing:** Day 2

**Subject Line:** Character stayed the same. Panel still looks wrong.

**Preview Text:** Consistency isn't enough if your framing is broken...

---

### Email Body

Consistency problem solved. Same face across all 6 panels. Same costume. Same scar. Victory.

Panel 3 looks flat.

Characters floating in dead center. No depth. No weight. The background feels disconnected from the subject like a green screen composite that didn't quite work.

Panel 4 is boring. Straight-on medium shot. Again. Third time in a row. Readers' eyes slide past it because nothing pulls attention.

Panel 6 is supposed to be the emotional climax. Your protagonist confronting the villain. But the composition is identical to the dialogue panels before it. No tension. No drama. The moment falls flat.

Consistent characters in bad compositions is still bad comics.

AI models don't understand shot framing. They don't know that a low angle makes a character feel powerful. They don't know that negative space creates tension. They don't know that Dutch angles signal instability. Unless you prompt these explicitly, you get the default: centered subject, neutral angle, predictable depth.

Professional comic artists spend years learning how panels guide the eye. How establishing shots set geography before close-ups drive emotion. How leading lines pull readers through action sequences.

You don't need years. You need the vocabulary AI models actually parse.

"Low angle shot," "worm's eye view," "dramatic lighting from below," "negative space left of subject"—these translate directly to visual output. The Composition section of your prompt library includes syntax for 12 different camera angles and their emotional effects.

Thursday I'm sending you the legal problem that can kill your comic overnight. Not dramatic—operational. The kind of thing you discover when your account gets suspended.

## Email 3: The Legal Blindspot

**Send Timing:** Day 4

**Subject Line:** This ToS clause can kill your comic overnight.

**Preview Text:** Nobody reads Terms of Service until their account is suspended...

---

### Email Body

Midjourney's free trial prohibits commercial use.

That's paragraph 4 of their Terms of Service. Most creators don't read it.

You publish on Webtoon. You're hoping for ad revenue eventually. That's commercial use. That's a ToS violation. One email from Midjourney's legal team and your comic is removed.

DALL-E output ownership is cleaner. You own what you generate through paid ChatGPT. But OpenAI's content policy restricts certain depictions. Your edgy cyberpunk comic includes a scene that crosses their line. API access revoked. 200 panels in, you need a new tool.

Webtoon updated their Terms of Service in January 2024. AI-generated content must be disclosed. You didn't know because you didn't re-read the ToS after signing up in 2023. They pull your series. Your 8,000 subscribers get a notification that the comic is "under review."

The legal side of AI comics isn't glamorous. It's reading license agreements. Tracking platform policy updates every quarter. Documenting your workflow in case someone questions your rights.

I track this because most creators won't.

The Legal Survival Guide section of your download folder contains:
- License matrix comparing Midjourney, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion commercial terms
- Platform policy database for Webtoon, Tapas, Instagram, and Amazon KDP
- 12 real case studies of legal disputes with outcomes and prevention lessons
- Copy-paste AI disclosure templates for your About page

"I didn't know" isn't a defense when your comic is removed and your audience is gone. "I documented my compliance" is.

Saturday I'm sending you the workflow problem that makes creators quit by Episode 12. It's not about skill. It's about systems.

## Email 4: The Workflow Spiral

**Send Timing:** Day 6

**Subject Line:** 6 hours for 4 panels. That's not sustainable.

**Preview Text:** Speed without systems is just chaos at higher velocity...

---

### Email Body

Hour 1: Writing dialogue, planning beats. Productive.

Hour 2: Generating Panel 1. Twelve attempts to get the angle right. Acceptable—creative iteration is part of the process.

Hour 3: Panel 2. Character drifted. Back to reference images. Six regenerations to match Panel 1. Frustrating but fixable.

Hour 4: Realized Panel 1's resolution is wrong for Webtoon vertical scroll format. Re-export at 800px width. Wait—now the colors look different. Check color space. Wrong profile. Re-export again.

Hour 5: Lettering in Photoshop. Forgot to save panel layers separately. Speech bubble placement requires moving the character layer. That layer is flattened. Start assembly over.

Hour 6: Done. Four panels. You're exhausted. You promised yourself Episode 3 would be posted by Friday. It's Thursday night.

This is creation without workflow. Every session reinventing solutions to solved problems.

The 4-Panel Workflow Checklist breaks the process into 4 phases with checkboxes:

**Pre-Production (30 min):** Story beats confirmed. Character references loaded in reference panel. Target platform export specs documented. Shot list for each panel written.

**Generation (90 min):** Panel-by-panel prompting with consistency checks after each. Seed anchored. Reference image in Discord side-by-side. Quality verification before moving to next panel.

**Post-Production (60 min):** Layer organization before assembly. Speech bubble templates loaded. Color space verified. Master file saved with layers intact.

**Publishing (30 min):** Platform-specific export settings. Filename convention for series tracking. Metadata tags applied. Distribution scheduled.

Students using this checklist cut production time from 6.5 hours to 3.8 hours average. Not through shortcuts—through not repeating solved problems.

Tomorrow I'm sending you an offer. Not a pitch. An offer for the complete system that makes Episode 50 faster than Episode 5.

## Email 5: The Complete System

**Send Timing:** Day 7

**Subject Line:** The system that separates Episode 50 creators from Episode 12 burnouts.

**Preview Text:** Everything I know about AI comic creation. No filler.

---

### Email Body

Five emails. Four problems.

Character consistency—why your protagonist has 6 different faces and how to lock visual identity across panels.

Panel composition—why beautiful characters in boring frames still fail, and how to prompt for dynamic shots.

Legal exposure—the ToS clauses that can kill your comic overnight and how to document compliance before you need to.

Workflow chaos—why 4 panels take 6 hours and how checklists compress that to under 4.

The free resources fix pieces. The Masterclass fixes the whole system.
