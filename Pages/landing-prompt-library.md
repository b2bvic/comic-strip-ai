# ABOVE THE FOLD

## Headline

**50 AI Prompts That Force Character Consistency Across Comic Panels**

## Subheadline

Stop regenerating the same panel 40 times hoping your protagonist's face stays consistent. These prompts work on Midjourney, DALL-E 3, and Stable Diffusion XL.

## Problem Snapshot

You spent 3 hours generating the perfect protagonist in Panel 1.

Panel 2: different face. Panel 3: costume changed colors. Panel 5: you're rage-clicking through variations trying to get the same person twice.

# BELOW THE FOLD

## Problem Section (Expanded)

### The Problem Isn't Your Skill. It's the Tool.

Midjourney doesn't remember your character.
DALL-E doesn't track continuity.
Stable Diffusion starts fresh every single prompt.

The tutorials that work for them don't mention the 30 failed generations before the winner. They show you results. They don't show you the workflow that makes consistency mechanical instead of accidental.

**The math:**

- 5 main characters in your comic
- 20 panels per chapter
- Average 8 regenerations per panel to get consistency
- = 800 generations per chapter, minimum

That's not a creative process. That's a lottery.
